# Make sure to not add a desktop environment to Debian for headless install

Install sudo && add to sudoers

# Formatting and Mounting additional hard drive

Open fdisk to create new partition.

    - "sudo  [fdisk or] /sbin/fdisk /dev/sda"

        # Inside of fdisk promt window type the following commands

            "-n" to create new partition table
                -- inside of this window you will be prompted to make the size of the drive. leave default if using entire drive.

            "-w" to write a table to disk and exit
                -- confirm with "y" and exit.

# Making Filesystem -

    - "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda[X]"
        # Make sure "x" equals your partition number eg. (/dev/sda1)
        # This creates an ext4 filesystem that is compatible with Linux.

# Mounting Hard Drive on Boot -

    Make sure the hard drive is detected with-

        - "lsblk"

    Make the directory where you want to mount the hard drive -

        - "sudo mkdir /mnt/path_to_hdd"

    Mount hard drive (in this case /dev/sda[X]) to directory -

        - "sudo mount /dev/sda[X] /mnt/path_to_hdd"

# Editing /etc/fstab to automatically mount hard drive on boot

    Get UUID with:

        - "sudo blkid"

    Edit fstab directory with -

        - "sudo nano /etc/fstab"

    Add the following line to the bottom of your fstab directory -

        - "UUID="d08f0efc-1e17-4db8-9df0-1e3e6f99e543"     /mnt/path_to_hdd"

            # Make sure to replace the UUID with the one provided by the blkid command.
            # Make sure /mnt/path_to_hdd is your correct mounting path for the hard drive.
