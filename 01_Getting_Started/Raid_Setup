# How to make a Raid array (Not so detailed because original copy was accidentally deleted)

# Double check all steps before executing to ensure proper configuration

# In this example I am making /dev/sda1/ and /dev/sda2 into a Raid 1 configuration name "md0"

    "sudo apt install mdadm"

# Partition Disks

    "lsblk"
    "sudo /sbin/fdisk /dev/sdb"
    "sudo /sbin/fdisk /dev/sdc"

        # In fdisk enter these commands

        "d" - deletes old partition
        "n" - make new partition
            Partition number - default
            First sector - default
            Last sector - round off the last few numbers so they are even with each other - eg. (The Default is 23437768703 and it becomes 23437760000)
        "t" - creates partition type
            "fd" - Linux filesystem
        "w"

    "lsblk"

# You should see /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 created.

# Creating a Raid 1 array named md0 with /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1

    "sudo /sbin/mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1"

# View progress of resync

    "cat /proc/mdstat"
    "ls /dev | grep md"
    "lsblk"

        # You can reboot and write to Raid array before process finishes

# Edit mdadm.conf so raid array persists after reboot

    "sudo su"
    "sudo mdadm --detail --scan > /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf"

# Make filesystem

    "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0"

# Mount filesystem and change ownership

    "mkdir /mnt/Raid_1"
    "sudo chown ashep:ashep Raid_1/"
    "sudo nano /etc/fstab"

        # copy this into fstab -
            "UUID="f5f8f38e-584c-4fdb-92f6-db41edaf2731"     /mnt/Raid_1 ext4 defaults 0 0
