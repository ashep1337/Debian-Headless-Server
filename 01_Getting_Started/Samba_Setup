# Mounting an existing SMB fileshare -

    Make sure all dependecies are installed. The ones I needed are:

        - "sudo apt install psmisc"
        - "sudo apt install cifs-utils"

    Once installed mount the SMB share with the following command (making sure to replace the username and IP address + Path with the correct data) -

        - "sudo mount -t cifs -o user=[username] //[IPaddress/path/to/share] /mnt/path_to_share/"
        - "sudo mount -t cifs -o user=ashep //192.168.1.187/Network /mnt/smb/"
            #add option ",uid=[user]" in order to give it user ownership
        - Eg: "sudo mount -t cifs -o user=ashep,uid=ashep //192.168.1.36/sambashare /mnt/path-to-share/"

    Files should be available at /mnt/smb now.

# Installing Samba and creating SMB share -

    To install Samba, we run:

        - "sudo apt update"
        - "sudo apt install samba"

    Create a directory for it to share:

        - "mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/"

    The command above creates a new folder sambashare in our home directory which we will share later.

    The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

        - "sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf"

    At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:


        [sambashare]
            path = /home/username/sambashare
            read only = no
            browsable = yes
            writeable = yes
            create mask = 0755


    Then press Ctrl-O to save and Ctrl-X to exit from the nano text editor.

    Restart Samba for it to take effect:

        - "sudo service smbd restart"

    Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:

        - "sudo ufw allow samba"

    Additionally we may need to chmod the directory to give write access with:

        - "sudo chmod 777 /mnt/path_to_hdd"
            or
        - "sudo chmod 777 /mnt/hdd1"
