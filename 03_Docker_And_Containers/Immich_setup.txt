# Create a directory of your choice (e.g. ./immich-app) to hold the docker-compose.yml and .env files.
# Move to the directory you created

    mkdir /immich-app
    cd /immich-app

# Download docker-compose.yml and example.env by running the following commands:

# Get docker-compose.yml file

    wget -O docker-compose.yml https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml

# Get .env file

    wget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env

# Edit .env file

    Change "UPLOAD_LOCATION" to the specified path of your choosing. In my case I set it to /mnt/hdd1/Immich/

    Change "DB_PASSWORD" if you would like.

    Set timezone by uncommenting TZ= line

docker compose up -d
