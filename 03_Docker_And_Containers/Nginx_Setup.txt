# Create a directory to store files. I do everything in ~/Docker/Nginxproxymanager

    Create a docker-compose.yml file:

        version: '3.8'
        services:
        app:
            image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
            restart: unless-stopped
            ports:
            # These ports are in format <host-port>:<container-port>
            - '80:80' # Public HTTP Port
            - '443:443' # Public HTTPS Port
            - '81:81' # Admin Web Port
            # Add any other Stream port you want to expose
            # - '21:21' # FTP

            # Uncomment the next line if you uncomment anything in the section
            # environment:
            # Uncomment this if you want to change the location of
            # the SQLite DB file within the container
            # DB_SQLITE_FILE: "/data/database.sqlite"

            # Uncomment this if IPv6 is not enabled on your host
            # DISABLE_IPV6: 'true'

            volumes:
            - ./data:/data
            - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt


    Then:
        "docker compose up -d"

# Setting up Proxies (using SSL certificates):

    In this example I'm setting up a proxy for my Plex server so it routes traffic from 192.168.1.36:32400 to plex.shephard.cc.

    Details:
        Select "Add Proxy"
            Domain Names: shephard.cc
            Scheme: http (If supported use https)
            Forward Hostname/IP: 192.168.1.36
            Forward Port: 32400
    SSL:
        SSL Certificate: shephard.cc
        Force SSL: Yes

Save configuration and a proxy should spin up.

# Configure router to point to Nginx

    You will need to point each domain to your Nginx IP address in order for Nginx to handle to port forwarding.

    For Unifi follow these instructions:
        Network Manager > Settings > Routing > DNS
        "Create Entry"
            Type: Host (A)
            Domain Name: plex.shephard.cc
            IP Address: 192.168.1.36
            TTL: Auto

    When you type in plex.shephard.cc you should now be redirected to 192.168.1.36:32400
