# Download Plexmediaserver with wget:

        - "wget https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-media-server-new/1.32.5.7349-8f4248874/debian/plexmediaserver_1.32.5.7349-8f4248874_amd64.deb"

    Go into directory where .deb file is located and install with:

        - "sudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver_1.41.3.9314-a0bfb8370_amd64.deb"
            # Make sure plex*.deb file is correct (do not copy/paste)

    Access web portal through another computer on port 32400

        Website should be http://[ipaddress:32400/web]
            "http://192.168.1.36:32400/web"

    Optionally you can forward the port 32400 from your router and be able to access your Plex from anywhere.

        In Unifi go to Security > Port Forwarding

            Create a rule:

                From: Any
                Port: 32400
                Forward IP: 192.168.1.36 [Plex IP address]
                Forward Port: 32400
                Protocol: Both

    Then click your icon in the top right of Plex and click Account Settings

    On the left column under Settings > Remote Access you may have to manually select the "retry button"

    If there is a green check mark you are good to go!
