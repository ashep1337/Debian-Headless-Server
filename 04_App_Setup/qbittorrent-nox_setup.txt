# Bug found where port does not change. Edited with --webui-port=8888 and port remains 8888 even after creating .service file. Advise to select port first with "sudo qbittorrent-nox --webui-port=8765" before creating background service.

    "sudo systemctl enable qbittorrent-nox"
    "sudo systemctl enable qbittorrent-nox@ashep" (might be needed if top one does not work)
